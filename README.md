# JRUNNER
jrunner is a simple code runner that makes things simple, supports more than 15 languages!

## Why does this make life much easier?
Case 1: you have only 1 type of supported file in a single project dir.

example structure (generated with tree command)
.
├── iusearchbtw.txt
├── Main.java
├── notmypasswords.csv
└── something.txt

1 directory, 4 files

What if i dont want to do the usual things?
I just type "j" in the terminal or the corresponding alias you have set for the script.
And it compiles your .java file in our case with javac and runs the .class file afterwards auto.





Supported lang list:
cpp
bash
c
d
java
go
python
ruby
php
lua
javascript
typescript
kotlin
swift
perl
